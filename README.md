# Global Doc API Service Integration Guide

This is a developer documentation project that I have created with sample and sanitized text content to replicate a standard API Integration Guide. The main purpose of creating this repository is to showcase a sample project with sanitized content.

This site uses Mkdocs as Static Site Generator, GitHub for storage and versioning, and Read the Docs for deployment. The content is created using Markdown. I have also added a CI for automated documentation testing for links, spellings, and stylistic consistency (using Vale) using the GitHub Actions workflow. For now, these checks are added only as part of the git push workflow.
