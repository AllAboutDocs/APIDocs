# Global Doc API Service Integration Guide

This is a document that I have created with sample and sanitized text content to replicate a standard API Integration Guide. The main purpose of creating this repository is to practise the various docs-as-code approaches with different static site generators and different deployment systems.

This site uses Mkdocs as Static Site Generator, GitHub for storage and versioning, and Read the Docs for deployment. The content is created using Markdown. I have also added a CI for automated documentation testing for links, spellings, and stylistic consistency (using Vale) using the GitHub Actions workflow. For now, these checks are added only as part of the git push workflow.
