# Create a new Doc

This request creates a new Docs account in the Docs ecosystem and establishes a docs container for a user. A user can have one or more docs, each identified by a unique Docs ID, linked user ID, and type.

A Docs object represents a user's document container.  
When you call this endpoint:

- If the **user does not exist**, a new user is created automatically using `externalId`and then passing the `X-User-Id` value in the header during Docs creation.
- If the **user already exists**, the Docs object links to an existing `owner.id`. You must provide **either**: `owner.id` **or** `externalId`
